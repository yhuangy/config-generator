# Configuration File Generator for Autograder

**This is still experimental.**

This is a Streamlit-based tool developed to help generate `config.py` files for weekly auto grading tasks. It provides a simple interface to

- Define expected DataFrame variables

- Specify expected columns in each DataFrame

- Select columns whose types should be displayed in the autograder output

- Preview the generated configuration and download it as `config.py` for easy integration.
